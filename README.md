# UE5 VR Template built by GitHub Actions

This is a practise project to get experience with
setting up GitHub Actions on Unreal Engine projects.

The goal was to build the default Unreal Engine 5.4.4 VR Game Template, to Linux and Android
(for the Oculus Quest, and other Android-based standalone VR headsets).  
However, due to storage limitations of GitHub Actions,
I had to give up on the Android builds.

I hope to return to this at some point in the future,
and to make it fully work, then.

Until then, at least the Linux build works!

In the [`docs`](docs) directory of this repository, I also have a guide that I wrote for my team this project was for.  
It explains how to set up their development environment with Perforce and Unreal Engine.
